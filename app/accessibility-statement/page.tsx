      <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
      <p className="last-updated">Last updated: January 30, 2026</p>

      <p>
        We are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.
        This Accessibility Statement outlines our commitment to accessibility and describes the measures
        we have implemented to make our Services accessible to everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Our Approach to Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to design and maintain our website and services in alignment with the Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, where reasonably practicable.
        Accessibility considerations are integrated into how we design, write, and maintain our product as it evolves.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Accessibility Considerations</h2>
      <p>Our services are built with the following principles in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard-accessible navigation for core interactions</li>
        <li>Clear structure, headings, and readable text</li>
        <li>Sufficient color contrast for readability</li>
        <li>Responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes</li>
        <li>Meaningful labels for interactive elements</li>
        <li>Avoidance of unnecessary visual or cognitive complexity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We strive to ensure the experience remains usable with common assistive technologies,
        while recognizing that not all accessibility needs can be fully addressed at every stage of development.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        StartupOps AI is an evolving product. Some areas of the site or third-party integrations
        may not yet fully meet accessibility standards. We actively improve accessibility as part of
        ongoing product development and prioritize issues that materially impact usability.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Feedback and Support</h2>
      <p>
